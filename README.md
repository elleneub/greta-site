# Greta Neubauer's Campaign Website

A simple html, css, and minimal javascript website based on a template.

## Dependencies

Uses Font Awesome 4.1.0 for the fonts and icons,

Uses Bootstrap v3.3.6 for styling and layout. Note that bootstraps utility spacing classes were added in v4.Attempts to Bootstrap 4 resulted in super broken styles, I'm guessing this theme is using overrides or something that aren't compatible.

## Deployment

This site is deployed via FTP (FileZilla) to an iPage server where Elle Neubauer is hosting it.

## Todos

- Make website secure (ssl cert and TLC)
- Add donate button to top of page on mobile
